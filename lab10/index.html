        <p>My name is Keren Petion. I am currently a forensic science major on the pre med track but I am looking to transfer into the ischool as an information tech/management or data analytics major.</p>
        <p>My interests as a forensic science major was to eventually go to med school and become a specialized surgeon, but now I’m considering working with businesses and companies and being apart of their startup process especially in areas that require design such as a web front face, or store front face, or even app user ability. I graduated high school in 2020, and I have done some writing for different school newspapers.</p>

        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>Outside of school I really like to have fun and live life to the fullest. I like to bake and keep up with fashion. I really like getting my nails done but I usually don’t because I don’t enjoy sitting there long enough to get them done. I like to read <strong>sometimes.</strong> I have 4 older siblings - I’m the youngest in my family. </p>
