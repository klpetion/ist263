    <body>
        My name is Keren Petion! I am currently a forensic science major on the pre med track but I am looking to transfer into the ischool as an information tech/management or data analytics major. My interests as a forensic science major was to eventually go to med school and become a specialized surgeon, but now I’m considering working with businesses and companies and being apart of their startup process especially in areas that require design such as a web front face, or store front face, or even app user ability. I graduated high school in 2020, and I have done some writing for different school newspapers. Outside of school I really like to have fun and live life to the fullest. I like to bake and keep up with fashion. I really like getting my nails done but I usually don’t because I don’t enjoy sitting there long enough to get them done. I like to read sometimes. I have 4 older siblings - I’m the youngest in my family.
