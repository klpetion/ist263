       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>My name is Keren Petion. I am currently a forensic science major on the pre med track but I am looking to transfer into the ischool as an information tech/management or data analytics major.</p>
       <p>My interests as a forensic science major was to eventually go to med school and become a specialized surgeon, but now Iâ€™m considering working with businesses and companies and being apart of their startup process especially in areas that require design such as a web front face, or store front face, or even app user ability. I graduated high school in 2020, and I have done some writing for different school newspapers.</p>
